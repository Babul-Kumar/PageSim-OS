**Interactive Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator**

An interactive web-based simulator that visualizes and compares page replacement algorithms used in Operating Systems.

This tool demonstrates how FIFO, LRU, and Optimal algorithms manage memory frames using step-by-step visualization, performance metrics, and algorithm comparison graphs.

It is designed as an educational platform for students learning virtual memory and paging concepts.

🚀 Features
📊 Algorithm Simulation

Supports major page replacement algorithms:

🔹 FIFO (First In First Out)

🔹 LRU (Least Recently Used)

🔹 Optimal Page Replacement

🔍 Step-by-Step Visualization

Visual representation of how pages move through memory.

Frame allocation timeline

Page hit & page fault highlighting

Memory frame tracking

📈 Performance Metrics

The simulator automatically calculates:

Total requests

Page faults

Page hits

Hit ratio

Fault ratio

📉 Algorithm Comparison Graph

Compare algorithms visually using charts:

Page faults

Page hits

Hit ratio

Graphs help students understand algorithm efficiency clearly.

⚠️ Belady’s Anomaly Detection

Demonstrates cases where:

Increasing the number of memory frames increases page faults in FIFO.

This concept is important in Operating System memory management theory.
